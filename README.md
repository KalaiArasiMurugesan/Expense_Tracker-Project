# Expense_Tracker-Project

About The Project

Expense Tracker Project aims to simplify the cumbersome task of maintaining a record of expenses on a monthly basis.
This project with a simple GUI enables a user to login his/her expenses with date and category as additional parameters. It is also capable of doing a small analysis of what percentage of income was spent on what .

This is written for personal use , in the sense the project is capable of supporting only a single user.
